# youtube-music-desktop
A simple web-based Linux client for YouTube Music created using qtws


## Installation
Arch Users can simple install the application using the AUR
* Issue the command: `yay install youtube-music-desktop`
Other users can simply add the files marking them executable and placing them within the scope of the `PATH`

Maybe the instructions themselves are quite redundant as it's such a simple project :P
